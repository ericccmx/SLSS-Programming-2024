# Table in Markdown

Name       | Age        |Coolness     | Superpower

To make a list we use the following:

* This is the first item in the list
* This is the second
    * This is actuallly a subpoint in this list

- This is also a list
- You can use these as bulletes as well
    - You can also use sublists with dashes

1. This is the first item in an ordered list
3. This is the second
    1. This is a sublist
    2. Another item
        - This is unordered
        - Same here
