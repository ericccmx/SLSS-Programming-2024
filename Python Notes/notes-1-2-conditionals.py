# Create two variables, x and y
x = 1_000_000
y = -5.2

# If x is less than y, print that
# if x < y:
#     print ("x is less than y")    

# # If x is greater than y, print that
# if x > y:
#     print("x is greather than y")

# # If x equals y, print that
# if x == y:
#     print("x equals y")

# if x < y:
#     print("x is less than y")
# elif x > y:
#     print("x is greater than y")
# else:
#     print("x equals y")

# Ask the user what their favourite fruit is
fave_fruit = input ("What's your favourite fruit?")

# Ask the user how old they are
user_age = input("How old are you?")

# If they answer apple or orange
if fave_fruit == "banana" and user_age == "16":
    print("Delicious choice")
